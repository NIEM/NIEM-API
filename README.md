# NIEM API

The 2.0 version of the NIEM API is a two-year effort to:

- Modernize the current NIEM API (version 1.1) and move from SOAP (WSDL files, XML) to REST (OpenAPI, JSON).
- Provide tool support for community content, including IEPD extensions.
- Expand functionality and transition lead developer resources to open source products as part of the NIEM move to an OASIS Open Project.
- Leverage the NIEM Common Model Format (CMF) as a way of providing transformations between various NIEM representations (NIEM XML, JSON schema, OWL, RDF, UML, etc.).

Basic installation and build information is included below.  The main project documentation is available at **https://niem.github.io/NIEM-API**, including the background, basic roadmap, OpenAPI files, JavaDocs, and more.
